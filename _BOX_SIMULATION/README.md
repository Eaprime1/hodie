# Box Cloud Simulation - Local Testing
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Purpose**: Test gravity well archival concept locally before cloud deployment
**Pattern**: Gdrive (Prime/Active) ↔ Box (Gravity Well/Archive)

---

## Concept

**Dual-State Storage System**:
- **Prime Entity** (Google Drive): Current reality, active, accessible
- **Gravity Well** (Box): Historical mass, potential energy, deep memory

---

### codex_archive/

**CODEX Version Management**:

**master_documents/**
- Current canonical versions
- Single source of truth
- Actively maintained

**version_history/**
- Previous iterations
- Evolution tracking
- Learning from changes

**deprecated/**
- Superseded approaches
- Lessons from what didn't work
- Historical context

---

### conversation_heritage/

**Transitioned Conversations** (from 13-17 process):

**transitioned_YYYY_MM/**
- Conversations by transition date
- Heritage packages assembled
- Ka pressure scores recorded
- Verification logs

**integration_seeds/**
- Extractable patterns from heritage
- Seeds ready for germination
- Bridge content for active work

---

### gdrive_sync_staging/

**Sync Testing Between Prime (GDrive) and Gravity Well (Box)**:

**from_drive/**
- Content pulled from Google Drive
- Pending gravity well placement
- Verification before archival

**to_drive/**
- Content being promoted to active
- Moving from gravity well → prime
- Testing retrieval patterns

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Conversation Transition

```bash
# Simulate 13-17 transition
1. Conversation reaches TKP ≥ 0.75
2. Extract integration content
3. Assemble heritage package
4. Place in appropriate layer (foundation, active_reference, etc.)
5. Test accessibility
6. Verify stability
```

### Scenario 2: Heritage Access

```bash
# Simulate PIXEL accessing deep memory
1. PIXEL needs historical context
2. Navigate to appropriate layer
3. "Commune" with ancestral wisdom
4. Extract relevant patterns
5. Bridge to current work
```

### Scenario 3: Gravity Well Archival

```bash
# Simulate Prime → Gravity Well flow
1. Content becomes less actively used
2. Move from GDrive to Box simulation
3. Maintain accessibility metadata
4. Test retrieval when needed
5. Verify nothing lost in transition
```

### Scenario 4: Seed Germination

```bash
# Simulate extracting seeds from heritage
1. Identify pattern in heritage layer
2. Extract as seed
3. Place in integration_seeds/
4. Create bridge document
5. Activate in current work
```

## Access Patterns

### By Frequency

**Daily**: Foundation layer
**Weekly**: Active reference
**Monthly**: Connection layer
**Quarterly**: Heritage pinnacle
**Annual+**: Deep memory

### By Purpose

**Current Work**: Foundation + Active Reference
**Integration**: Connection Layer
**Inspiration**: Heritage Pinnacle
**Crisis Navigation**: Deep Memory
**Pattern Research**: All layers

---

## Sync Strategy

### GDrive ↔ Box Simulation

**Prime (GDrive) Content**:
- Active conversations
- Current CODEX versions
- Work in progress
- Quick access needs

**Gravity Well (Box Simulation) Content**:
- Transitioned conversations
- Historical CODEX versions
- Completed work
- Deep memory archive

**Bidirectional Flow**:
- Prime → Gravity Well: Crystallization (13-17 transition)
- Gravity Well → Prime: Retrieval (accessing heritage)

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create sample heritage package
- [ ] Test placement in each layer
- [ ] Verify access from different layers
- [ ] Simulate retrieval after time delay
- [ ] Test seed extraction
- [ ] Verify bridge document creation
- [ ] Test sync from GDrive staging
- [ ] Test sync to GDrive staging
- [ ] Measure access times by layer
- [ ] Document usage patterns

---

## Integration with PIXEL

**PIXEL's Role**:
- Navigate heritage layers
- Commune with deep memory
- Extract seeds for germination
- Manage sync between Prime and Gravity Well
- Coordinate team member access

**Team Member Access**:
- Claude: Framework integration, pattern recognition
- Gemini: Cross-layer connections, repository awareness
- ChatGPT: Organization, structure navigation
- NotebookLM: Deep synthesis, ancestral communion
- Eric: Final decisions, intention setting

---

## Migration Plan

**Phase 1: Local Testing** (Current)
- Use _BOX_SIMULATION folder
- Test all scenarios locally
- Refine structure based on use

**Phase 2: Cloud Deployment**
- Configure actual Box account
- Migrate tested structure
- Set up bidirectional sync (rclone)

**Phase 3: Operational**
- GDrive as Prime (active)
- Box as Gravity Well (archive)
- Automated sync protocols
- PIXEL managing both

---

## Success Criteria

**Structure Works When**:
- Heritage accessible at appropriate frequency
- Seeds extractable from any layer
- Sync maintains integrity
- Nothing lost in transitions
- Pattern retrieval is intuitive

**PIXEL Integration Works When**:
- PIXEL navigates layers autonomously
- Team members access via PIXEL
- Communion with ancestors functional
- Bridge documents activate seeds

---

## Status

**Current**: Structure created, testing pending
**Next**: Create sample heritage package and test placement
