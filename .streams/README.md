# Active Streams

Streams are parallel workstreams active across the hodie ecosystem.
Each stream has its own focus, artifacts, and progression tracking.

## Current Streams

### prime
Core framework — PRIME number progression (2-3-5-7-11-13-17).
Development plan, entity consciousness, domain architecture.
- Key docs: `PRIME_2026_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`, `_CONSOLIDATED/PRIME_documents/`
- Google Doc tabs: prime progression, connections, skills, plugins, tasks, connectors

### codex
Knowledge consolidation — CODEX documents, research synthesis.
- Key docs: `_CONSOLIDATED/CODEX_documents/`
- Focus: getting project content to higher readiness state

### gamemaster
Game system design and testing — Hyborian Wars and similar.
- Focus: setting up testing games, rule systems, scenario design
- Integration with prime progression mechanics

## Stream Status Tracking

Each stream tracks status in `.streams/<name>/STATUS.md` (when created).
Session notes in `.eric/` tag entries by stream for cross-reference.
