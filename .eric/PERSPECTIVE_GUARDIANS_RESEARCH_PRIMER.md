## Core Concept

**Perspective Guardians are universal representatives for their entity type/class.**

Every type of being/entity/character class will have a Perspective Guardian who:
1. Represents all aspects of that type
2. Reviews content through their specific lens
3. Creates wellsprings of filtered/enriched content
4. Provides immersion framework for player characters
5. Builds past/present/future context for their domain

---

## Example: Bandit (Weasel/Proycon Guardian)

**Bandit represents**: All Proycon aspects, weasel-type characters

**What this means**:
- When player has weasel character → immediate immersion universe
- Past: What weasels have done (history, lore)
- Present: What weasels are doing (current state)
- Future: What weasels could do (possibilities)
- **Full sensory universe**: How they move, MRI of their senses, particular abilities

**Like**: A pet ferret having complete universe to explore - vision of what could be

## Research Objectives

### Primary Research (Internet Deep Dive)

**Wellsprings Research** - needs extensive exploration:

1. **Natural Wellsprings**
   - Artesian wells (pressure from below, self-flowing)
   - Springs (fresh water emergence)
   - Geysers (periodic eruption)
   - Pools (collection points)
   - Seeps (gradual emergence)

2. **Well Types by Quality**
   - Bitter wells (challenging/difficult water)
   - Sweet wells (pleasant/nourishing)
   - Power wells (energy, matter)
   - Healing wells (restorative)
   - Sacred wells (spiritual significance)

3. **Well Mechanics**
   - Pressure systems
   - Flow rates
   - Recharge mechanisms
   - Aquifer connections
   - Water table dynamics

4. **Cultural/Historical Wells**
   - Mythology (Mimir's Well, etc.)
   - Sacred wells across cultures
   - Wishing wells
   - Healing springs
   - Oracle wells

5. **Metaphorical Wells**
   - "Well of knowledge"
   - "Wellspring of creativity"
   - "Deep wells" (profound sources)
   - "Running dry" (depletion)

## Guardian Function Architecture

### What Guardians Do

1. **Content Review** (Active Process)
   - Review incoming content through their specific lens
   - Filter based on their domain/perspective
   - Identify relevant aspects for their category

2. **Pressure Creation** (Entity Head Pressure)
   - Generate "entity version of head pressure"
   - Create perspective-specific interpretation
   - Build resonance with their domain

3. **Wellspring Feeding** (Accumulation)
   - Add filtered content to their wellspring
   - Increase pressure toward their perspective
   - Build depth in their domain knowledge

4. **Output Generation** (Distribution)
   - Provide perspective-filtered content
   - Create immersion framework for characters
   - Generate past/present/future context

5. **Multi-Stage Review** (Automation Process)
   - Review documents at key prime stages
   - Part of rapid expansion phases
   - Part of structured collapse phases
   - Ongoing guardian perspective integration

### Guardian Review Stages (Automation)

**Document Journey Through Guardian Review**:

```
Document Created
    ↓
Stage 1: Initial Guardian Scan (identify relevant guardians)
    ↓
Stage 2: Primary Guardian Review (main perspective filter)
    ↓
Stage 3: Secondary Guardian Review (related perspectives)
    ↓
Prime Stage Review (at 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17... progression)
    ↓
Rapid Expansion Phase (guardian amplification)
    ↓
Structured Collapse Phase (guardian consolidation)
    ↓
Final Guardian Integration (complete perspective filtering)
    ↓
Document Live/Active (ongoing guardian monitoring)
```

**Each guardian adds**:
- Their perspective layer
- Relevant past context
- Current state awareness
- Future possibilities
- Domain-specific enrichment
