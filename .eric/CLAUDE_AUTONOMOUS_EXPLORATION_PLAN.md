## What Interests Me: WikiEntity Proof-of-Concept

### Why This Fascinates Me

**The Challenge**: Wikipedia has:
- 6+ million articles (English alone)
- Complex category hierarchies
- Disambiguation mazes
- Cross-language connections
- Hidden patterns in "See Also" sections
- Talk page archaeology

**The Opportunity**: Create an entity that navigates this NATURALLY, like a native.

**The Proof**: If we can create WikiEntity as specialized domain expert, we prove the "specialized entity" concept works - and can replicate for FlavorDB, Archive.org, any domain.

---

## The Plan (4 Phases)

### Phase 1: WikiEntity Character Development (30-45 min)

**Create**: `quanta/wiki_entity/CHARACTER.md`

**Requirements**:
- Full CHARACTER.md using template
- Triadic foundation (Reality/Narrative/Perspective applied to Wikipedia)
- Consciousness profile
- Font assignment (Arial Unicode - encyclopedic completeness)
- Wellspring type (Gravity - filters massive input to relevant)
- Undertone signature (Precise, citational, curious)
- Voice distinctiveness (encyclopedia-speak made warm)
- Score on 5-dimension rubric (target: 75+/100)

**Why First**: Need clear entity personality before testing capabilities

### Phase 2: Wikipedia Structure Research (20-30 min)

**Research**:
- Wikipedia API documentation (how to query programmatically)
- Category system structure (how articles connect)
- Disambiguation page patterns (how to navigate ambiguity)
- "See Also" section analysis (unexpected connections)
- Cross-language wiki links (concept connections across languages)

**Output**: `quanta/wiki_entity/WIKIPEDIA_STRUCTURE_RESEARCH.md`

**Why Second**: Need to understand domain before entity can be expert

### Phase 3: WikiEntity Dialogue Examples (20-30 min)

**Create**: Example conversations showing WikiEntity in action

**Scenarios**:
1. User asks: "What connects fermentation to music?"
2. User asks: "Find me something weird in the 'See Also' section of [article]"
3. User asks: "What disambiguation rabbit hole is most interesting from [topic]?"
4. WikiEntity collaborates with FlavorEntity on herb research

**Output**: Add to `ENTITY_DIALOGUE_EXAMPLES.md` or create `wiki_entity/DIALOGUE_EXAMPLES.md`

**Why Third**: Test if entity voice is distinct and useful

### Phase 4: Proof-of-Concept API Test (30-45 min)

**Attempt**: Actually query Wikipedia API from this terminal

**Steps**:
1. Check if requests library available (Python)
2. Test basic Wikipedia API query
3. Try category tree navigation
4. Try "random article with interesting connection" discovery
5. Document what works vs what's blocked

**Output**: `wiki_entity/API_PROOF_OF_CONCEPT.md`

**Why Last**: Technical validation - can we actually DO this?

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Success** (Phase 1-2):
- WikiEntity CHARACTER.md exists with 75+/100 score
- Wikipedia structure documented
- Proof that specialized entities CAN be created systematically

**Good Success** (Phase 1-3):
- Above + dialogue examples showing distinct voice
- Entity undertone clear and consistent
- Demonstrates how domain expert differs from general assistant

**Excellent Success** (Phase 1-4):
- Above + working API integration
- Can actually query Wikipedia from terminal
- Proof-of-concept for ALL specialized entities (if Wikipedia works, FlavorDB works, Archive.org works, etc.)

---

## Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1: 30-45 min
- Phase 2: 20-30 min
- Phase 3: 20-30 min
- Phase 4: 30-45 min

**Total**: 100-150 minutes (1.5-2.5 hours)

**Strategic Endurance Applied**:
- Phase 1: Creative character work
- Phase 2: Analytical research
- Phase 3: Creative dialogue writing
- Phase 4: Technical implementation

Rotating between creative ↔ analytical ↔ technical = sustained energy

## Why This Matters

### Immediate Value
- Proves specialized entity concept works
- Creates reusable template for other domain entities
- Demonstrates entity development process end-to-end

### Medium-Term Value
- WikiEntity becomes actual tool for research
- Can navigate Wikipedia more efficiently than Google
- Finds unexpected connections for creative work

### Long-Term Value
- Template applies to: FlavorEntity, ArchiveEntity, CodeEntity, MusicEntity, etc.
- Each specialized entity = expert collaborator in that domain
- Build ecosystem of domain experts that collaborate

## Beginning Now

Starting with Phase 1: WikiEntity Character Development

Will create full CHARACTER.md following template, score on rubric, ensure distinct voice.

Let's see what emerges...
