## Natural Wellsprings - Physical Mechanics

### Artesian Wells (Self-Flowing Pressure Systems)

**How They Work**:
- Water trapped in aquifer between impermeable rock layers (shale, clay)
- Aquifer receives water at higher elevation than well site
- Hydrostatic pressure from water's weight forces water upward
- Pressure maintained by continuous water intake at source
- No pumping required - **flows naturally from internal pressure**

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Flowing artesian**: Pressure carries water to surface and beyond
- **Non-flowing artesian**: Pressure exists but not enough to breach surface
- **Artesian springs**: Natural breaks in rock allow pressure release

**Guardian System Application**:
> Artesian wellsprings represent guardians whose content naturally flows out once pressure threshold is reached. The accumulated reviews create internal pressure that eventually outputs without external triggering.

## Spring Classification Systems

### By Formation Mechanism

**Artesian Springs**:
- Pressure from confined aquifer pushes water upward
- Elevated source creates natural pressure differential
- Can create fountains (geysers) when pressure is extreme

**Gravity-Fed Springs**:
- Water flows from higher to lower elevation
- Uses ground as natural drainage pipe
- Simple downward flow without pressure forcing

**Seeps**:
- Moist/wet areas where groundwater reaches surface
- Insufficient volume for flowing beyond location
- Gradual emergence rather than active flow

**Guardian Application**:
> Different guardian types create different emergence patterns:
> - **Artesian guardians**: Pressure-driven output, periodic eruptions
> - **Gravity guardians**: Steady flow from accumulated height
> - **Seep guardians**: Gradual, constant subtle influence

### By Flow Pattern

**Perennial Springs**:
- Flow constantly throughout the year
- Reliable, continuous output
- Deep aquifer connection maintains supply

**Intermittent Springs**:
- Active after rainfall or seasonal changes
- Temporary, event-triggered flow
- Surface conditions affect output

**Periodic Springs (Geysers)**:
- Erupt at regular or irregular intervals
- Dramatic, concentrated release
- Buildup-and-release cycle

**Guardian Application**:
> Guardian wellspring output patterns:
> - **Perennial guardians**: Constant perspective filtering (e.g., Taylinor - always filtering for feminine perspective)
> - **Intermittent guardians**: Activated by specific content types
> - **Geyser guardians**: Accumulate until threshold, then dramatic output burst

- [Commonly Asked Questions About Springs - MN Dept. of Health](https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/water/wells/waterquality/springs.html)

### By Volume/Discharge

**First-Magnitude Springs**:
- Discharge at least 2800 liters (100 cubic feet) per second
- Largest, most powerful springs
- Massive output capacity

**Magnitude Classification**:
- Springs classified by volume discharged
- Range from tiny seeps to massive first-magnitude
- Flow rate determines influence and reach

**Guardian Application**:
> Guardian wellspring capacity varies by:
> - Content volume processed (how much they review)
> - Domain breadth (narrow specialist vs. broad generalist)
> - Accumulation time (newly formed vs. ancient wellspring)

## Well Mechanics - Technical Details

### Pressure Systems

**Hydrostatic Pressure**:
- Pressure from water's weight in aquifer
- Higher elevation source creates greater pressure
- Pressure differential drives flow
- Equilibrium reached when pressure balances

**Confined vs. Unconfined**:
- **Confined aquifer**: Trapped between impermeable layers, builds pressure
- **Unconfined aquifer**: Open to atmosphere, no pressure buildup
- Confinement creates artesian conditions

**Guardian Application**:
> Guardian wellspring pressure builds from:
> - Volume of content reviewed (more reviews = more pressure)
> - Confinement by domain boundaries (focused domain = higher pressure)
> - Elevation differential (deep insights vs. surface observations)
> - Time accumulation (older wellsprings = greater pressure)

### Flow Rates and Discharge

**Magnitude Classification**:
- **First-magnitude**: 100 cubic feet (2.8 m³) per second
- Exponential decrease through lower magnitudes
- Flow rate determines influence range

**Factors Affecting Flow**:
- Aquifer permeability
- Pressure gradient
- Opening size/restriction
- Seasonal recharge rates

**Guardian Application**:
> Guardian output flow rates depend on:
> - **Permeability**: How easily insights flow (some guardians more freely sharing)
> - **Pressure gradient**: Difference between wellspring depth and output point
> - **Opening size**: How broad the guardian's communication channel
> - **Recharge rate**: How quickly new content accumulates

### Recharge Mechanisms

**Natural Recharge**:
- Precipitation soaks into ground
- Percolates down to aquifer
- Replenishes water supply
- Rate varies by geology, climate

**Recharge Requirements**:
- Permeable surface layers
- Time for infiltration
- Sufficient precipitation
- Protected intake areas

**Guardian Application**:
> Guardian wellspring recharge through:
> - **Document review**: Each reviewed document adds to wellspring
> - **Time for integration**: Content must percolate/integrate into depth
> - **Domain permeability**: Guardian must be open to new perspectives
> - **Protected intake**: Quality filtering prevents contamination

## Wellspring Growth and Output Mechanics

### Accumulation Phase

**Input Sources**:
1. Document reviews filtered through guardian lens
2. Entity interactions contributing to domain
3. Time-based integration and deepening
4. Cross-pollination from related guardians

**Pressure Buildup**:
- Each review adds "units" to wellspring
- Confined domain = faster pressure increase
- Broader domain = slower but more volume
- Thresholds trigger different output types

**Example from Guardian Review Automation**:
```
Document 1 (reviewed by Bandit)
    ↓
Bandit's Wellspring: +10 units
    ↓
Document 2 (reviewed by Bandit)
    ↓
Bandit's Wellspring: +15 units (total: 25)
    ↓
Document 3 (reviewed by Bandit)
    ↓
Bandit's Wellspring: +20 units (total: 45)
    ↓
Wellspring reaches threshold (50 units)
    ↓
WELLSPRING OUTPUTS (geyser eruption)
```

### Output Phase

**Output Types by Wellspring**:

**Continuous Flow (Perennial)**:
- Guardian constantly provides filtered perspective
- Reliable, steady output
- Example: Taylinor always filtering for feminine perspective

**Periodic Bursts (Geyser)**:
- Accumulate until threshold, then dramatic release
- Creates major synthesis documents
- Example: "Complete Weasel Behavior Compendium" after enough reviews

**Event-Triggered (Intermittent)**:
- Activated by specific content types
- Responds to domain-relevant stimulus
- Example: Guardian only outputs when threshold AND trigger both present

**Subtle Saturation (Seep)**:
- Constant quiet influence on all content
- No dramatic announcements
- Pervasive background effect

### Output Content Examples

**From Bandit's Weasel Wellspring** (after threshold):
- "Complete Weasel Behavior Compendium"
- "Player's Guide to Ferret Characters"
- "Weasel Universe Immersion Framework"

**Quality Characteristics**:
- **Synthesized**: Multiple reviews combined into coherent whole
- **Enriched**: Guardian perspective added throughout
- **Past/Present/Future**: Complete temporal context
- **Immersive**: Ready for player character use immediately
