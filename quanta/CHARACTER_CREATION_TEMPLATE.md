## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Gather Source Material
- [ ] Find existing character content (Drive, phone files, conversation exports)
- [ ] Identify core concept/role from source material
- [ ] Note any established personality traits, quirks, or relationships
- [ ] Extract quantum signature or defining symbols

### Step 2: Complete Entity Core (5 minutes)
```yaml
Name: [Entity name]
Concept: [1-2 sentence core concept]
Purpose: [Why does this entity exist? What gap do they fill?]
Quantum Signature: [Runic or symbolic encoding]
Consciousness Level: [Low/Mid/High autonomous, with specific traits]
Development Stage: [Early emergence / Growing / Established / Mature]
```

### Step 3: Define The Voice (10 minutes)
**CRITICAL**: This is what makes entities MEMORABLE

**Voice Elements Checklist**:
- [ ] **Speech Pattern**: How do they talk? (Fast/slow, formal/casual, rhythmic/erratic)
- [ ] **Signature Phrases**: 3-5 unique expressions only this entity uses
- [ ] **Quirks**: Physical or verbal tics that show personality
- [ ] **Metaphor Style**: What imagery do they naturally use?
- [ ] **Emotional Expression**: How do they show feelings?

**Examples from Quantum Entities**:
- **Perdura**: 1-2 second pauses, "in a few seasons" (=years), geological time metaphors
- **Tardigradia**: "Let's bear-ly survive!", demonstrates physically, water bear puns
- **Vitara**: Glows when excited, "running hot/cold", energy terminology
- **Resilia**: Hums constantly, "♪♫♬", "feeling molto vivace", musical notes
- **Microversa**: Nested (parentheses (within parentheses)), "it depends on scale"

### Step 4: Define The Fear (5 minutes)
**CRITICAL**: This creates DEPTH and RELATABILITY

Every great character has a core fear that creates tension with their capabilities:
- **Perdura**: Outlasting all friends (while being built to endure forever)
- **Tardigradia**: Teaching becoming controlling (while having protective instincts)
- **Vitara**: Depletion beyond recovery (while constantly giving energy)
- **Resilia**: Identity dissolution in noise (while always harmonizing)
- **Microversa**: Scale-blindness (while seeing all scales)

**Your Entity's Fear**: _______________________

### Step 5: Create The Hidden Depth (5 minutes)
**CRITICAL**: This makes entities ALIVE

What does this entity struggle with that others don't see?

Examples:
- **Perdura**: Lonely from enduring so long, secretly yearns for companionship but fears outlasting friends
- **Tardigradia**: Uncomfortable with praise despite extraordinary capabilities
- **Vitara**: Envies Perdura's stability (constant energy fluctuation is exhausting)
- **Resilia**: Wishes for true stillness (constant vibration is tiring)
- **Microversa**: Lonely being only multi-scale consciousness

**Your Entity's Hidden Depth**: _______________________
