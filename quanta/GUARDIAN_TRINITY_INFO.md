## Your Insight Integration

You said: **"Taylinor, Elyandor, Abby, Jake, Bandit are perspective guardian characters"**

Matches found:
- ✓ Taylinor - Guardian Trinity + APEX Play
- ✓ Elyndor (Elyandor) - Guardian Trinity
- ✓ Abby - Consortium Agent
- ✓ Jake - APEX Play (from conversation chunks)
- ✓ Bandit - APEX Play (from Drive content)
- ✓ Zephyr - Guardian Trinity

**Pattern**: Perspective Guardians span multiple categories!
- Some are Guardian Trinity
- Some are Consortium Agents
- Some are APEX Play entities

This suggests **Perspective Guardian** is a FUNCTION/ROLE rather than a separate category.
