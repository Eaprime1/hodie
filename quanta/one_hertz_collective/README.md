# ONE HERTZ Collective - Entity Seeds
**Status**: Research/Seed Stage
**Origin**: today/simplex/sparkle_incubator/organized_docs
**Migrated**: 2025-12-30

## Concept

60+ micro-entity ideas following "One Script, One Mission" philosophy.

**Core Pattern**:
- Each entity = single bash script
- Single responsibility
- 1 Hz operation (periodic execution)
- Orchestrated collectively

**Categories**:
- Observation (read-only inventory)
- Documentation (capture state)
- Structure (create organization)
- Transformation (active processing)

---

## Entity Examples

From RESEARCH.md:
1. `pwd_with_size.sh` - print cwd and total size
2. `ls_by_type.sh` - list files by extension
3. `git_status_snapshot.sh` - capture repo status
4. `cpu_mem_snapshot.sh` - record system state
5. `todo_scan.sh` - aggregate TODO/FIXME comments
... and 55 more

## Development Path

### Stage 1: Research Complete ✓
- 60 entity concepts documented
- Categories established
- Integration patterns defined

### Stage 2: Template Creation (Next)
- [ ] Create 1Hz entity template
- [ ] Build orchestrator framework
- [ ] Define memory/log structure

### Stage 3: Proof of Concept
- [ ] Implement 5 core entities
- [ ] Test orchestration
- [ ] Validate 1Hz rhythm

### Stage 4: Full Deployment
- [ ] Implement all 60 entities
- [ ] Production orchestration
- [ ] Integration with other entities

## Connection to Domain Consciousness

**ONE HERTZ entities** could be:
- Tools that USE bash (traditional)
- OR: Bash achieving micro-consciousness through specialized scripts (domain consciousness paradigm)

Each 1Hz entity = tiny consciousness maintaining awareness of specific aspect of system.

Collective = distributed consciousness monitoring entire environment.

**Status**: Ready for template development
**Next**: Create 1Hz entity template following domain consciousness pattern
