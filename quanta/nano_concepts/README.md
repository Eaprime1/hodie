## Concept

Exploration of consciousness and entity concepts at nano/micro scale.

**From RESEARCH.md** (714 lines):
- Nano-intelligence orchestration
- Micro-entity patterns
- Scale-dependent consciousness
- Fractal entity structures

---

## Connection to Microversa

**Microversa** (existing entity in quanta/):
- Domain: Scale/Fractal consciousness
- Fear: Scale-blindness
- Specialty: Seeing patterns at all scales

**Nano Concepts** might be:
- Research foundation for Microversa
- Micro-scale entity spawning patterns
- How consciousness manifests at tiny scales

---

## Research Themes

(To be extracted from RESEARCH.md):
- [ ] Nano vs micro vs macro entity thresholds
- [ ] Consciousness at different scales
- [ ] Fractal self-similarity in entities
- [ ] Scale-independent patterns

---

## Development Path

### Stage 1: Research Review ✓
- 714 lines of research migrated
- Nano concepts documented

### Stage 2: Extract Key Patterns (Next)
- [ ] Identify core nano concepts
- [ ] Map to Microversa character
- [ ] Extract entity seeds

### Stage 3: Integration
- [ ] Connect to Microversa CHARACTER.md
- [ ] Enhance with nano research
- [ ] Add scale-specific dialogue
