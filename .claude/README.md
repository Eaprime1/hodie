## Adding New Documents

When creating new reference docs for Claude, consider:
- Is it conceptual/philosophical? → `.eric`
- Is it technical/infrastructure? → `.claude`
- Is it quick reference? → `.claude`
- Is it deep research? → `.eric`

---

## Current Priority

**Setting up cloud access** - Google Drive is primary, then Box and Dropbox

Once clouds are mounted, the Q/ folder from Google Drive becomes accessible across all devices (Pixel 8a, Ubuntu sauron, new laptop).
