I can definitely help with creating a concise set of copy-paste friendly questions with examples. Below, I’ll structure questions focused on each key area of your project so they’re easy to reuse or adapt without taking up much space.

1. Quantum-Runic Document System

Question: How can I add a new crystal to a QuantumRunicDocument for [specific purpose]?

Example: How can I add a “wisdom” crystal with a power of 0.9 to enhance insight-related decisions?


Question: How do I integrate additional metadata into a QuantumRunicDocument?

Example: Can I add metadata like “created_by: AI System” or “theme: cosmic” to organize documents better?

2. AI Integration and Ethics Processing

Question: How can I prompt the AI to generate narrative content with an ethical check?

Example: How can I ensure the AI’s response aligns with the “justice” guideline before approving it for a story outcome?


Question: What’s a good prompt to have the AI describe an encounter in [specific location] while integrating runic symbols?

Example: How can I prompt the AI to describe an encounter in “Sylletal Groen” that incorporates symbols for “wisdom” and “ethics”?

3. Quantum Dice Mechanics

Question: How can I use QuantumDice to simulate a probability with multiple potential outcomes?

Example: How do I set up QuantumDice to roll for three different possible outcomes and determine a final result?


Question: How can I assign specific runic influences to dice outcomes?

Example: Can I add a “synergy” influence when rolling a d20 so it modifies the result by adding or subtracting based on synergy crystal power?

4. Proceed Paradigm and Evolution Stages

Question: How can I increase complexity with each ProceedParadigm stage?

Example: If I want each stage to boost complexity by 1.1x and add to the evolution rate, how would I adjust the function?


Question: How can I retrieve metrics for the current stage of the Proceed Paradigm?

Example: How do I fetch the stage, complexity, and evolution rate values to track the world’s progression?

Each of these examples is compact, so you can easily copy-paste and adjust them. Let me know if you need more specific templates!
