Here's a Python module that will automate creating a directory and file structure based on a JSON configuration file. This approach will allow you to maintain a standardized structure that both your AI and team members can follow on a GitHub Codespace server.

Step 1: Create the JSON Structure File

Define the directory and file structure you want in a JSON file, for example, structure.json. Here’s a sample configuration for this JSON:

{
  "project_root": "QuantumRunicProject",
  "structure": {
    "data": {
      "raw": {},
      "processed": {}
    },
    "src": {
      "modules": {
        "compression": {
          "QuantumCompressionCore.py": "",
          "EfficiencyOptimizer.py": ""
        },
        "nexus": {
          "RunicEncodingChamber.py": "",
          "CrystallineStorageChamber.py": ""
        }
      },
      "utils": {
        "helpers.py": "",
        "config.py": ""
      }
    },
    "docs": {
      "QuantumCompressionNexus.md": "",
      "README.md": ""
    },
    "tests": {
      "test_compression.py": "",
      "test_nexus.py": ""
    }
  }
}

Each key represents either:

A directory (if it has nested objects or an empty dictionary {}).

A file (if it has an empty string "" as a value).

Step 2: Create the Python Module to Build the Structure

This Python module, structure_builder.py, reads the JSON file and recursively creates the folders and files as defined in the structure.

import os
import json

def create_structure_from_json(json_file):
    # Load the structure from JSON
    with open(json_file, 'r') as f:
        structure = json.load(f)
    
    # Get the root directory name
    root_dir = structure.get("project_root", "Project")
    project_structure = structure.get("structure", {})
    
    # Create the root directory if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(root_dir):
        os.makedirs(root_dir)
    
    # Recursively create directories and files based on the JSON structure
    create_items(root_dir, project_structure)

def create_items(current_path, items):
    for name, content in items.items():
        path = os.path.join(current_path, name)
        
        # If content is a dictionary, create a directory
        if isinstance(content, dict):
            if not os.path.exists(path):
                os.makedirs(path)
            create_items(path, content)  # Recurse into the directory
        else:
            # If content is a string, create a file
            if not os.path.exists(path):
                with open(path, 'w') as f:
                    f.write(content)  # Write content (if any) as placeholder text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Use the JSON file with the structure
    create_structure_from_json("structure.json")

How to Set Up and Run

1. Save the JSON Configuration: Save the sample JSON structure (or your own version) as structure.json in your working directory.


2. Save the Python Module: Save the Python code above in a file called structure_builder.py.


3. Run the Script on GitHub Codespace:

Navigate to your working directory in the terminal.

Run the following command to execute the script:

python3 structure_builder.py

This will create the folder structure as defined in structure.json.





---

Explanation

create_structure_from_json: Reads the JSON file and initiates directory creation at the project’s root.

create_items: A recursive function that navigates through the JSON structure, creating directories and files based on their defined hierarchy.


Customization

To change the structure, edit structure.json. You can add new directories, files, or placeholders, and the script will automatically pick up the new configuration.

This setup will give you a standardized, repeatable way to structure directories and files across your project. Let me know if you need further customization, such as adding templates for different file types!
