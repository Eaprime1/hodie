In the realm of Bayesian probability, the concept of "possibility" can be understood as an event or hypothesis having a non-zero probability. More precisely, in Bayesian statistics, the probability attached to a hypothesis (representing a possibility) reflects an individual's degree of belief in that hypothesis being true. 
Key aspects
Degrees of Belief: Unlike the frequentist interpretation, where probability represents the long-term frequency of an event in repeated trials, the Bayesian view interprets probability as a measure of belief or uncertainty.
Prior and Posterior Probabilities: In Bayesian inference, a prior probability for a given hypothesis (initial belief) is used. This prior is updated with new evidence or data using Bayes' theorem, resulting in a posterior probability (revised belief after considering the evidence).
Incorporating Information: Bayesian methods allow beliefs to be updated rationally based on new information. This is useful when dealing with limited data or situations where prior knowledge is important.
Hypothesis Testing: Bayesian inference is used for hypothesis testing, where evidence supporting different hypotheses is evaluated, and decisions are made based on the strength of that evidence. 
Possibility vs. Probability
While sometimes used interchangeably in everyday language, there is a distinction between "possibility" and "probability" in a Bayesian context. 
Possibility: An event or hypothesis is possible if it can be conceived without contradiction and has a probability greater than zero.
Probability: The probability quantifies the degree of belief or the mathematical chance of a possible event occurring, usually expressed as a percentage or fraction between 0 and 1. 
In simpler terms, something can be possible (its probability is > 0) but not very probable (its probability is low). For instance, winning the lottery is possible, but not probable. 
Conclusion
The Bayesian interpretation of "possibility" recognizes that events or hypotheses exist within a spectrum of belief, quantified by probabilities, which can be updated with new evidence using Bayes' theorem. This framework offers a robust way to reason about uncertainty and make informed decisions, especially in situations with limited information or when incorporating prior knowledge is beneficial.
