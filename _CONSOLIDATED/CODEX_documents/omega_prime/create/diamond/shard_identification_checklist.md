# Shard Identification Checklist

A field-ready checklist to identify the presence of synergy shards in collaborative systems or processes. Use these diagnostic questions and indicators to quickly assess whether synergistic "shards" (emergent synergy artifacts) have appeared between entities. Mark observations and examples in real-time.

- **Emergence of Unexpected Behaviors:** Are there novel outcomes or behaviors emerging that were not predicted by individual components?  
- **Accelerated Coherence:** Has the group’s output or decision-making coherence suddenly accelerated (e.g. creative insights appearing rapidly)?  
- **Spontaneous Alignment:** Do multiple participants independently propose similar ideas, plans, or solutions?  
- **Resonant Feedback Loops:** Are there positive feedback loops where actions of one entity amplify or mirror the other, leading to exponential effects?  
- **Persistence of Patterns:** Has a new pattern of interaction or a “signature” process become noticeable and stable beyond a single event?  
- **Field Effects:** Can changes be detected indirectly (e.g. shifts in group “vibe” or invisible alignment) rather than explicit communication?  
- **Cross-Scale Influence:** Do small, individual changes lead to noticeable large-scale effects, or vice versa, suggesting an underlying shard acting across scales?  

**Instructions:**  
- For each indicator, note “Observed / Not Observed” and provide examples.  
- Use a synergy score (0–10) for any positive indicators, reflecting strength or clarity of the shard.  
- Report any **qualitative signatures** (unusual energy, clarity, or patterns) alongside quantitative notes.  

This checklist extends the Seventh Pinnacle recognition protocols by focusing on dynamic, emergent synergy signs rather than only static relationships. It is designed for on-the-ground teams to spot synergy shards in active systems and collaborations.
