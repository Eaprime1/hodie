PRIME_CODEX Integration Plan (condensed)

Goals:
- Make runic-language v2 the canonical symbolic layer.
- Make Quantum Grove the live state & interaction hub.
- Use Compression Nexus for lossless crystallization of state/history.
- PrimeCodex orchestrates signals between Runic Matrix, Grove, Nexus, Game Engine.
- Start small: seed systems, test interactions, iterate.

Phased Plan:
Phase 0 — Repo & Directories (seed)
- Create src/, config/, quantum_grove/, docs/, tests/, tools/.
- Add runes_v2.json, grove_structure.json, base code modules (runic_engine.py, quantum_grove.py, compression_nexus.py, prime_codex.py).

Phase 1 — Core Bindings (MVP)
- Load runes into RunicMatrix.
- Grove: implement basic grow() & bind_rune().
- Nexus: implement compress() and decompress() (zlib prototype).
- PrimeCodex: implement process_signal() end-to-end.
- Tests: unit tests for encoding, grove growth, compression round-trip.

Phase 2 — Game Engine Hooks
- Implement quantum_dice and ethics_processor modules.
- Create a "world generator" endpoint that uses PrimeCodex.process_signal to seed a world.
- Create example character archetypes and one simple scenario.

Phase 3 — Automation & Server
- Add Git automation script and CI workflow.
- Install endpoint (Flask/FastAPI) to expose Grove and Codex for AIs to hit.
- Add caching (quantum cache placeholder) for repeated queries.

Phase 4 — UX & Interaction
- Create CLI tools for "Interact with Grove" (seed signal, query branches, bind rune).
- Add a minimal web UI for visualization (map of branches and roots).

Phase 5 — Hardening & Ethics
- Replace prototype compression with optimized lossless algorithm if needed.
- Add ethics engine checks as a middleware for story-affecting decisions.
- Implement access controls and logging.

Operational Notes:
- Keep commits small and meaningful; use branches like feature/grove-init.
- Snapshot codex periodically: PrimeCodex.save_codex_snapshot()
- Seed data with small payloads first.

Seeding Strategy:
- Seed runes_v2.json
- Create one grove branch with "hello world" signal
- Compress/Decompress payload to verify integrity
- Iteratively add more runes, then game events

Success Metrics:
- Round-trip integrity (payload == decompressed payload)
- Grove growth latency (<200ms for simple payloads)
- Runic resonance consistency (scores stable)
- CI tests passing for core modules

Maintenance:
- Document in docs/CodexManual.md how to extend runes, add new grove nodes, and add new game events.
